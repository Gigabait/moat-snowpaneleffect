## An easy way to add snow to your derma panels
# DFrame:SetFestive( xpos, ypos, width, height )
## X and Y values are relative to the panel
### There's not very much FPS impact (5 or less). Users can disable the effect for all panels by typing "enable_snoweffect 0" in console. The snow melts when it touches the bottom. Looks good if you add a little white poly at the bottom of your frame.
